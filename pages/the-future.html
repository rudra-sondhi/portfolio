                <p1>In the future I want to either become a lawyer or a doctor.
                    Both of these are very challenging and competitive programs,
                    and it is necessary that I am well prepared for the challenges
                    that lie in my university and professional life. I also want to
                    start a business, which would be my source of passive income, and
                    I would like to perfect my knowledge on stocks; and include that as
                    another passive source of income. Finally I would like to help other
                    people throughout my life. It is necessary that humans stay grateful
                    for what they have and give back to those in need. I would like to
                    set up a charity where people can donate their hard earned money to
                    specific causes and help the less fortunate.
